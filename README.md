# JavaScript Practice Repository

![JavaScript]https://github.com/Shaikhnoman/JavaScript-Practice

Welcome to my JavaScript practice repository! This is where I experiment, practice, and improve my JavaScript skills. Here, you'll find a variety of scripts, challenges, and mini-projects that I've worked on while learning and refining my JavaScript knowledge.

## About

This repository is a collection of JavaScript exercises and projects that I've completed while practicing the language. It contains everything from beginner-level scripts to more complex applications that implement various JavaScript concepts such as DOM manipulation, asynchronous operations, object-oriented programming, and more.

## Projects

Here are some of the notable projects in this repository:

1. **Calculator App** - A simple calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. **To-Do List** - A dynamic to-do list with task management features.
3. **Weather App** - A weather application that fetches real-time weather data using an API.
4. **JavaScript Algorithms** - Solutions to common algorithmic problems, including sorting, searching, and recursion.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: The primary language used for all projects in this repository.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the web applications.
- **APIs**: Various public APIs for fetching data (e.g., weather, quotes).

## Installation

If you'd like to explore or run the code locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone (https://github.com/Shaikhnoman/JavaScript-Practice)
2. **Navigate to the project folder:**
